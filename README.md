Project Title: Exploring the relationship between GDP per capita and fertility rate

Description: In this report, we analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and fertility rate using data from 185 countries over the years 1800 to 2024. We retrieved the raw datasets from Gapminder.org which are included as CSV files. We created visualizations to showcase the relationship over time and in general. We then used simple linear regression to create a model to predict average fertility rate from average GDP per capita. To assess our model, we used predictive checks with simulation. Our results confirmed a negative association between GDP per capita and fertility rate, however we found that the model was not a great fit. Linear regression might not be the best modeling strategy for this dataset.
